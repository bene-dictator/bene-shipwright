# bene-shipwright
bene-shipwright is [https://github.com/bene-dictator](bene-dictator)'s plugin containing all their custom Endless Sky ships and outfits.

Anyone is free to use the data and images in this repository. It would be greatly appreciated if you would credit me if you do so.

## To-do
* Update the ship sprites.
** The Thunderbird does not look armored enough as the description claims.
** The Mercantor's texturing could be better, the cockpit has some shape but not much detailing, and the engines look like Navy designs. (That they look like Navy engines could be made intentional, though.)

* Give reasonable stats to Mercantor, Thunderbird, and Burster.
** The Mercantor is meant to be a faster, less combat-capable Clipper with more cargo capacity.
** The Thunderbird is meant to be a lower-tech, tanky ship that shows its age. It's like a civilian Frigate.
** I had the Burster's stats once, but they're gone :/

* Add more ships and outfits in the future.
