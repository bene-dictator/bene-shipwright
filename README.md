# bene-shipwright
bene-shipwright is a plugin for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) containing all of [bene-dictator](https://github.com/bene-dictator)'s vanilla-ish ships and outfits.

Anyone is free to use the data and images in this repository under the terms of the APGL-3.0 licence.

## To-do
Update the ship sprites.
* The Thunderbird does not look old or armored enough as the description claims.
* The Mercantor's texturing could be better, the cockpit could be improved (it has some shape but not much detailing), and the engines look like Navy designs. That they look like Navy engines could be made intentional, though.

Give appropriate stats to Mercantor, Thunderbird, and Burster.
* The Mercantor is meant to be a faster, less combat-capable Clipper with more cargo capacity.
* The Thunderbird is meant to be a lower-tech, tanky ship that shows its age. It's like a civilian Frigate.
