	description "The systems of the Deep are some of the most populous in human space, and its long independent history has led to a unique line of locally-designed ships whose development are somewhat separated from the rest of humanity."
	description "	The Mercantor is one of those ships, a freighter used for light courier work between Deep systems. Somewhat older than its competition, it is nonetheless a fast ship for its role and is often the starting point for aspiring Deep captains. However, it has a rather low stock fuel capacity, so it is not often found far from its home systems."

	description "The Thunderbird is a variant of the Firebird that is generally found in Coreward space. Like its cousin, it is a very tough ship that can simultaneously deal and take a large amount of fire, but it is bulkier and somewhat less up-to-date than the current iteration of the Firebird."
	description "	The Thunderbird diverged from the Firebird at a time when shield emitters weren't as reliably powerful as they are now. As such, this model prioritizes thick, durable armor, originally designed to resist heavy impacts with debris and impact rounds in poorly patrolled regions of space after combat or natural phenomena disabled the shield matrix itself."
	description "	Once making up the bulk of Syndicated Security fleets, Thunderbirds have largely been replaced by Megaparsec Splinters in the role of planetary defense and patrol owing to the Splinter's more modern and nimble design."
