	description "The Dual Proton Turret is the continuation of the Syndicate's development of the Proton Gun. Given the lack of any Particle Cannon turret so far, Syndicated Systems hopes to corner the market in turret-based heavy defence systems."

	description `This unlicensed modification of the Energy Blaster doesn't increase the strength of the blaster's energy bolts, but instead shoots a rapid barrage of them at the cost of a long cooldown period. It is a weapon favored by pirates in interceptors to rapidly take down larger ships and retreat while it cools down.`
	description `	Because its housing wasn't made for dense burst fire created by overloading the energy bolt generators, the Burster tends to melt in a protracted firefight.`
